Back end was created using node.js, Mongoose, and Express.

Database is Mongodb.

The todos can be found here https://mighty-dusk-75086.herokuapp.com/todos

This is the API the front end hits to make the POST, DELETE, and PUT requests.

Front end is hosted throught Netlify and is built with vanilla JS.

App can be found here https://trusting-fermat-fcf612.netlify.app/

To run locally, clone both repositories (todoapp-frontend and todoapp-backend)

Open them in a code editor like VS Code.

Change the api in the first two lines of the new.js file on the frontend to the localhost instead of the heroku app. Start a live server.

In the terminal start up the server for the backend.
